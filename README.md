# ETF Analyzer

# About

In recent years, finance has had an explosion in passive investing. Passive investing means that you invest in a basket of assets that’s called an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This way, you don’t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. ETFs offer more diversification.

In this Challenge assignment, I built a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

# What am I Creating

For this Challenge assignment, I needed to create and submit the following deliverables:

1. A Jupyter notebook that contains the following:

2. My analysis of the ETF data that a SQL database stores

3. Professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations
